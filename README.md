## Description
This is a portfolio to show potential future employers. It is made using react so that it is modular and easily scalable. New items or pages can be added with relative ease. Website is responsive across different screen sizes and links to several deployed applications. 

## Future Goals
Several sections of the website contain Lorem Ipsum text. This will be updated in the future. A requirement when building this was to include 6 projects, which I did, but the quality of some is much less than others. These will be swapped out for higher quality projects in the future. The resume is out of date and will be replaced with an updated on. Additionally, I am planning on removing the resume page and making the resume downloadable on the homepage/about-me section. It has it's own page now as that was a requirement while building this application. Finally, The portrait on the frontpage is a placeholder which will be replace with a professional looking picture of yours truly.
